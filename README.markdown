MS Web Dev stuff
================

This is just to make it easy to use vbnet.vim and aspnet.vim from  [@tpope](https://github.com/tpope) since he did not make them available for easy consumption by his awesome [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) plugin.

Get the originals from vim.org.

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/taylor/vim-mswebdev.git

*Yeh, what [@tpope](https://github.com/tpope) says:*

Before reporting a bug, you should try stripping down your Vim
configuration and removing other plugins.  The sad nature of VimScript
is that it is fraught with incompatibilities waiting to happen.  I'm
happy to work around them where I can, but it's up to you to isolate
the conflict.

If your [commit message sucks](http://stopwritingramblingcommitmessages.com/),
I'm not going to accept your pull request.  I've explained very politely
dozens of times that
[my general guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
are absolute rules on my own repositories, so I may lack the energy to
explain it to you yet another time.  And please, if I ask you to change
something, `git commit --amend`.
